# Digit_Recognition

The MNIST database contains binary images of handwritten digits commonly used to train image processing systems. The digits were collected from among Census Bureau employees and high school students. The database contains 60,000 training digits and 10,000 testing digits, all of which have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of 28 Ã— 28 pixels. Many methods have been tested with this dataset and in this project,we'll get a chance to experiment with the task of classifying these images into the correct digit using some of the methods.

This project will be split in two parts. Project 2 (this project) consists in the first part and project 3 will cover the second part.

Note on software: For all the projects, we will use python 3.6 augmented with the NumPy numerical toolbox, the matplotlib plotting toolbox. In this project, we will also use the scikit-learn package, which you could install in the same way you installed other packages, as described in project 0, e.g. by conda install scikit-learn or pip install sklearn

The archive contains the various data files in the Dataset directory, along with the following python files:

part1/linear_regression.py where you will implement linear regression
part1/svm.py where you will implement support vector machine
part1/softmax.py where you will implement multinomial regression
part1/features.py where you will implement principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction
part1/kernel.py where you will implement polynomial and Gaussian RBF kernels
part1/main.py where you will use the code you write for this part of the project
